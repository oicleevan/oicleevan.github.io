        <h3>Car Seat Headrest - Twin Fantasy (2018)</h3>

        <h4>reviewed august 12th</h4>

        <p>One of the best rock albums of the 2010s, Twin Fantasy is an incredibly heartfelt and powerful album. While the 2011 original is a quality release on its own, the 2018 re-recording is better in nearly every measure. The songwriting is great, especially considering that the album was written by a 19 year old kid. The instrumentation is great too; Will Toledo and co. succeed by deviating slightly from the indie rock formula with a lot of songwriting. Compared to the 2011 release, the performances and production have greatly improved, but it still has the feeling of roughness which adds a lot of charm and 'personality'. I love the story the album tells, and every song has its charm. Great!</p>

        <p><i><b>My favourite tracks: </b>Beach Life-In-Death, Bodys, Famous Prophets (Stars)</i></p>

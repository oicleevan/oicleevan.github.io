        <h3>Car Seat Headrest - Twin Fantasy (2018)</h3>
        <img src="https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0202599159_16.jpg" alt="ALBUM COVER">
        <h4>reviewed august 12th</h4>

        <p>One of the best rock albums of the 2010s, Twin Fantasy is an incredibly heartfelt and powerful album. While the 2011 original is a quality release on its own, the 2018 re-recording is better in nearly every measure. The songwriting is great, especially considering that the album was written by a 19 year old kid. The instrumentation is great too; Will Toledo and co. succeed by deviating slightly from the indie rock formula with a lot of songwriting. Compared to the 2011 release, the performances and production have greatly improved, but it still has the feeling of roughness which adds a lot of charm and 'personality'. I love the story the album tells, and every song has its charm. Great!</p>

        <h3>Dinosaur Jr. - You're Living All Over Me (1987)</h3>
        <img src="" alt="album cover">
        <h4>reviewed august 14th</h4>

        <p>An absolutely incredible album. It's incredibly noisy, but really melodic and beautiful at the same time. Almost country, in a sense. I love the songwriting; the sad slacker anthems the band is known for are admittedly catchy and great. The chemistry between J Mascis' effect-heavy guitar wizardry and Neil Young-esque drawl, Lou Barlow's chaotic yells and loud fuzzy bass, and Murph's drumming makes for a fantastic record. Every song is incredible and brings something new to the table. I love their cover of the Cure's Just Like Heaven; EVEN BETTER than the original.</p>

        <h3>Madvillain - Madvillainy (2004)</h3>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/5e/Madvillainy_cover.png" alt="ALBUM COVER">
        <h4>reviewed august 15th</h4>

        <p>An absolutely amazing album from rapper MF DOOM and producer Madlib. After some great work from both artists (The Unseen by Madlib, Operation: Doomsday by MF DOOM), the two convened together to make one of the best albums of all time.
        Madvillainy encompasses everything that makes the rap genre so great. Madlib's instrumentals are incredible, using sampling in so many innovative ways to make crazy good beats. DOOM is at the top of his game; his lyrics, flow, and voice are the perfect accompanyment to Madlib's beats. Every song meshes the strong suits of the two to such great effect. Just listen to Meat Grinder! There are too many amazing tracks to name. Despite being 22 tracks, it doesn't feel long, every song feels fresh in the context of the album.
        There aren't many features; most songs are just interplay between DOOM (in various pseudonyms) and Madlib (who takes vocals as Quasimoto on a few songs). On the songs that do have features though, everyone is great. I love MED's verse on Raid, especially.
        45 minutes of pure bliss. Essential listening.</p>

        <p><i><b>My favourite tracks: </b>Meat Grinder, Curls, Figaro, Fancy Clown, All Caps</i></p>

        <h3>Dead Kennedys - Plastic Surgery Disasters / In God We Trust, Inc. (1982)</h3>

        <h4>reviewed august 16th</h4>

        <p>An absolutely incredible compilation; the two best things Dead Kennedys ever did. Every song is kick ass powerful.
        Jello Biafra's frenzied lyrics are at their peak here imo, telling terrifying tales of terrible people in the wake of Reagan's America in his trademark vocal style. There's less of an emphasis on shock value here, making for a more well rounded experience compared to Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables.
        The instrumentation is great as well; East Bay Ray's guitar playing is a breath of fresh air in the early 80s hardcore scene and the rhythm section of Klaus Flouride and D.H. Peligro is great great great!
        Plastic Surgery Disaster is their best studio album, and In God We Trust, Inc. is a fantastic EP as well. An amazing highlight for 80s hardcore.</p>

        <p><i><b>My favourite tracks: </b>Buzzbomb, Well Paid Scientist, Nazi Punks Fuck Off</i></p>

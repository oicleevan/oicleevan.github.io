            <h3>June 1 — Minutemen - Double Nickels on the Dime</h3>
            <img src="https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5929be87eb335119a49ed090/1:1/w_600/3398a91b.jpg" alt="ALBUM COVER" class="center">

            <p><b>A weird and off-kilter album that has heart and a message.</b> Minutemen are one of my favourite punk bands, yet it's hard to describe them as such. With influences that draw more from funk and CCR than Black Flag or the Sex Pistols, their style of music is distinctly not punk, yet it makes them more punk than most of their contemporaries. A fourty track double album was never the norm, but Minutemen use it wisely! The band are very skilled instrumentalists, and they use the medium to its fullest capacity. The songwriting varies from notes left by neighbors about a broken tub to a vicious attack on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicaragua_v._United_States">the United States' interference in Nicaragua</a>. All things I can get behind!</p>

            <p><i><b>My favourite tracks:</b> Untitled Song for Latin America, Viet Nam, Corona, 'Take 5, D.'</i></p>

            <h3>June 2nd — Sonic Youth - Daydream Nation</h3>
            <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/ad/Daydreamnation.png" alt="ALBUM COVER" class="center">

            <p><b>An album that manages to strike a powerful balance of beauty and noise; abstractness and structure.</b> As the band moved away from their no-wave origins, Sonic Youth steadily became better and better. <i>EVOL</i> saw the band head in a gothic direction, and <i>Sister</i> showed a real promise of powerful (really) alternative rock. <i>Daydream Nation</i>, however, really fulfilled this development. The songs are longer, noisy breakdowns permeate through songs for minutes at a time, but every second serves a purpose, building an atmosphere of noise and beauty unlike anything before it, from themselves or anywhere else. Don't get me wrong, though, there are some beautiful moments on this album; the alternate tunings don't give the songs any kind of darkness as much as a level of, for lack of a better word, liveliness. FANTASTIC!</p>

            <p><i><b>My favourite tracks:</b> Teen Age Riot, The Sprawl, Trilogy</i></p>

            <h3>June 3rd — Radiohead - OK Computer</h3>
            <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/ba/Radioheadokcomputer.png" alt="ALBUM COVER" class="center">

            <p><b>An absolutely incredible album on all fronts that becomes more and more prescient with each passing day.</b> As the band became less and less interested in performing cliché alternative rock, their music became got exponentially better. From the mediocre <i>Pablo Honey</i> to the great but somewhat conventional <i>The Bends</i>, it was clear that the band had a desire to try something new. With OK Computer, they accomplished this in spades; an art-rock masterpiece that was uncannily ahead of its time, with topics of isolation, paranoia, and fear that seem all too present nowadays. Some amazing aural sounds coming through here, use of effects, production techniques, all that stuff that makes it sound amazing 25 years later. Can't say enough! <b>ESSENTIAL LISTENING.</b> </p>

            <h4>please come to boston.</h4>

            <p><i><b>My favourite tracks:</b> THE WHOLE THING, but especially Paranoid Android, Let Down, No Surprises, The Tourist</i></p>

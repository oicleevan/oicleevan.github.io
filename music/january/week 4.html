            <h3>January 24th — The Clash - Give 'Em Enough Rope (1978)</h3>
            <img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/91U+8UJ1+vL._SL1500_.jpg" alt="ALBUM COVER" class="center">

            <p><b>A classic punk album from some of the pioneers of the genre.</b> I would argue it is their best straight punk effort, more consistent than their debut with just as sharp of an edge. Drumming courtesy of Topper Headon is on point as always, production is clear and great, and some great songwriting and composition.</p>

            <p><i><b>My favourite tracks:</b> Safe European Home, Stay Free, Julie's Been Working for the Drug Squad</i></p>

            <h3>January 25th — Arctic Monkeys - Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not (2006)</h3>
            <img src="https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d0000b2736b3fa88bdd4af566fbbf2bbf" alt="ALBUM COVER" class="center">

            <p><b>With a harder edge than their contemporaries (The Strokes, Bloc Party), and a maintained indie credibility, this record makes for one of, if not <i>the</i> best alt-rock records of the 2000s.</b> Compelling lyrics and storytelling are displayed throughout the album, describing youth in the UK at the time, "love stories", the whole shebang. It's a record I always love coming back to; there's a reason they've become one of the biggest and longest lasting groups of their era!</p>

            <p><i><b>My favourite tracks:</b> Mardy Bum, When The Sun Goes Down, Perhaps Vampires is a Bit Strong But..., Riot Van</i></p>

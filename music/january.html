            <p><b>A classic punk album from some of the pioneers of the genre.</b> I would argue it is their best straight punk effort, more consistent than their debut with just as sharp of an edge. Drumming courtesy of Topper Headon is on point as always, production is clear and great, and some great songwriting and composition.</p>

            <p><i><b>My favourite tracks:</b> Safe European Home, Stay Free, Julie's Been Working for the Drug Squad</i></p>

            <p><b>With a harder edge than their contemporaries (The Strokes, Bloc Party), and a maintained indie credibility, this record makes for one of, if not <i>the</i> best alt-rock records of the 2000s.</b> Compelling lyrics and storytelling are displayed throughout the album, describing youth in the UK at the time, "love stories", the whole shebang. It's a record I always love coming back to; there's a reason they've become one of the biggest and longest lasting groups of their era, yet at the same time, I wish they maintained this energy for later releases!</p>

            <p><b>One of the finest post-hardcore albums ever!</b> Carrying on the legacy of frontman Ian Mackaye's previous band Minor Threat (!!!), the songs featured on this compilation have a hard edge and strong political/social tone to them (Waiting Room, Glue Man). Yet at the same time, the EPs break away from the hardcore formula, and take a more experimental and nuanced approach (Suggestion, Margin Walker). <i>Of course, Mackaye's never done anything wrong,</i> and this record is a fantastic example of that.</p>

            <p><b>After the experimental masterpiece that is <cite>Kid A</cite>, Radiohead take it back to basics (by their standards).</b> Arguably their most underrated album. It's beautifully understated at some moments and rocking at the next, and maintains the experimentation of <cite>Kid A</cite> & <cite>Amnesiac</cite>, while toning it down at the same time. While it certainly isn't their best effort, it is certainly a very pleasant record to listen too, and definitely ranks among my favourite releases by the band.</p>

            <p><i><b>My favourite tracks: </b>Sit Down, Stand Up, Where I End and You Begin, Backdrifts</i></p>

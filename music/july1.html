        <h4>reviewed july 21st</h4>

        <p>black midi leave post-punk behind, and in the process, create one of the most interesting and exciting albums of the last decade. Very few moments go to waste throughout this project, and the band weaves jazz, rock, and theatrics together to a powerful end.</p>

        <p><i><b>My favourite tracks:</b> Sugar/Tzu, Welcome to Hell, Dangerous Liasons, 27 Questions</i></p>

        <h3>Unwound - Repetition (1996)</h3>
        <img src="https://e.snmc.io/i/600/w/c26796ecff6830a0097d2df3400d0ff5/2185291/unwound-repetition-Cover-Art.jpg" alt="ALBUM COVER" srcset="">
        <h4>reviewed july 27th</h4>

        <p>Unwound refined their instrumentation and production with this album, and it has a significant impact on my enjoyment. The recording is a lot clearer and not as muddy than their previous albums, and the vocals are a lot more present (although they still could be louder!), which goes a long way. The performances are great. I love the interplay between the band. Justin Trosper's lyrics are enigmatic and compelling. Every song deserves its being in the album, and while it drags on towards the end, it gets great again with For Your Entertainment. They're no Fugazi, but this album heavily elevates Unwound's position in my head-canon.</p>

        <p><i><b>My favourite tracks:</b> Corpse Pose, Sensible, For Your Entertainment</i></p>
